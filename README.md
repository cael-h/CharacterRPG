### Character RPG App for Android

## Android app to create and chat with RPG characters.

- Android app for creating RPG characters, chatting (text or voice), and RPG-ing your own storyline.

- App is intended to allow users to upload character profiles and set voice models (tuned to whatever tone/attitude you want for your character).

- Interaction can be text to text, text to voice, and voice to voice. Environmental narration can be done by your character and your own player via speaking, or typing. You can specify that you want the NPC character to put narrations in the chat rather than saying them for better authenticity.

- Backend model (i.e., not the voice model) is powered by GPT or Gemini, and soon (hopefully) Venice and Grok.
