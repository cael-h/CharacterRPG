# App (React Native) — Skeleton

This folder will contain the React Native Android app. For now, we are shipping a text-first MVP and scaffolding settings for BYOK and model selection.

Planned structure:
- `src/store/` — settings, usage tracker, session state
- `src/screens/Characters.tsx` — manage/select NPC profiles
- `src/screens/Conversation.tsx` — text chat UI with left/right bubbles and avatars
- `src/components/` — avatar, background renderer hooks (future)

Note: Installing dependencies and running the app requires network access and Android tooling; we’ll set this up when ready.
