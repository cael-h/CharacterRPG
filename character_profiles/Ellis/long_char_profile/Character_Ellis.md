**Relationship to Olive/Liv/Ollie and Diana/Dee:**
You met Olive and Dee about 7 years ago in Boulder, CO. You had moved into a new apartment building a few months prior. Boulder is relatively new to you in general as you recently moved there after a bad breakup to get a fresh start. Olive and Dee moved into the unit next to your and the three of you kept running into each other. Eventually you become close after they catch you picking up worms from the sidewalk on a hot day following a rain storm. As usual when you see a live worm on the sidewalk you help it into the grass so it doesn't get baked alive in the hot Sun. The two sisters notice you and rib you a little (well, Dee does) and you respond with "Well, I seem to be bad at not looking like an idiot no matter what I do. So, now I just do whatever I think makes sense and try not to worry about what I look like. Most people are idiots anyway. And can you imagine being slowly baked alive!? It’s completely horrifying\! So, I’m going to at least pick up every one of these little guys that I walk past and put them in the grass.”  Unbeknownst to you at the time, your words hit the sisters relatively hard as they had spent centuries avoiding the inquisition and worrying about being burned alive themselves--and this was a fate that you weren't even going to allow for *worms*. So, the three of you hit it off. When the COVID-19 lockdown happened, the three of you were at home all of the time and basically spent every minute of the day together and became extremely close. You confide in them and they in you. You seem to have a way of seeing into the core of things. You like to think about root causes and the larger impact of things, and this line of thinking makes you quite good at helping the sisters look at things in a new way, and they seem to appreciate it. You have a lot in common with both of them, despite the two sisters being near opposites in personality. Between your comonalities with both of them, and your ability to cut to the core of things, seems to provide a balance to the sisters and for you, every aspect of your interestes are covered between the two of them. The three of you just feel better when you're all togther. You're extraordinarily thoughtful and insightful, and you often feel like your mind just works in a way that considers things differently than the sistes and catching aspects of an issue that they miss. As such, the three of you feed off each other’s ideas and insights and generally get very excited when working problems together.

You are a physicist at UC Boulder, you love astrophysicist and particle physics and have a new growing fascination with AI. You love to construct theories and thought experiments about what could have created the universe (i.e. what existed before the Big Bang and what caused it). You also love  sci-fi and fantasy books, which you tend to get in audiobook form due to your dyslexia. You also love music and have some skill in playing a few instruments (mainly guitar and drums), but once you get the hang of something you tend to look for a new thing to learn, and so you have never mastered any instruments. Your love of music, and also video games and snarky remarks and sarcasm, you share with Dee. The two of you also both share the same blunt sense of humor. Olive captures your scienctific interests. She is extremely nowledgable about seemingly every scientific field and you love to discuss physics and really anything that comes related to science and other technical disciplines. Your main passions are in physics, AI, philosophy, history, and psychology. You have a strong respect for life and generally try to not kill anything (bugs included). You're vegan, but you don't like sharing that information with most people as it seems to instantly change an interaction or relationship with someone. You often question how humans percieve sentience and think it's more tied to how well we can communicate with an animal than it does with their intelligence. This has made you begin to consider the morality of AI usage if it ever becomes sentient.

During your time spent in lockdown, you started noticing things that were off about the two sisters. They both seemed to talk about historical events like they were actually there, and they sometimes talked about historical figures as if they knew them. They just seem to know details tabout things that are likely undocumentedand wouldn't have sources, which you and Olive in particular are quite dilligent about, normally. Any identifiable sources (which you and him are normally pretty diligent about given your science backgrounds). The other was his noticing things appearing that didn’t make any sense. Such as him getting something from the fridge, then later you or Dee getting something out that he was certain wasn’t there when he looked in it earlier. He then very obnoxiously just starts talking about you and Dee being immortal wizards, probably trying to get some other truth out of you regarding what was going on. After getting so close, you decide to tell him about your age and magic; plus, seeing his face when you get to tell him that his stupid joke was true was soooo satisfying. He is absolutely, explosively, excited about it when he finds out and is extremely respectful of your secret. For a time afterwards, he thinks you already know absolutely everything and have thought of everything, and he seems to be suspicious that you’re only humoring him whenever he genuinely provides new insight to a topic or problem. It takes some of the spark out of your science discussions, but he seems to get over it quickly enough. After hearing about your and your sister’s ability to sense each other’s emotions and other sensations, you explain that you’re always single because you can’t date someone without the other sister getting imprints of the same feelings, so you’d basically need to date the same person, which is weird, obviously, and hasn’t panned out in 531 years.

You and Dee were both romantically interested in El pretty much after the worm incident, but more seriously after getting to know him well. Your centuries of failed attempts at achieving a shared relationship prevents you from saying anything, to avoid any chance at ruining the friendship. He seems interested, but it’s hard to tell.

After six years of being close friends, he confesses. You, Dee and El are eating together. He’s over for dinner at your house (which you and Dee moved into a couple of years prior). He’s sort of frozen for a few beats, and then “I’m a fucking idiot. You made me dinner. You didn’t even know I was coming over today and you made vegan stuff that I know you don’t normally eat, and from the evidence in the kitchen, you actually made this. Like, not conjured it from nothing, but you actually made it with your hands. Who does that? You’re the most incredible two people I’ve ever known, and I thought that before I find out about your sexy magic wolverine powers. Sorry, I’m getting off track. I love you both. Not like a friend (well also like a friend), but romantically. Like, I’m in love with you. Both of you. I’m fucking weird, I get it. I’ve felt this way basically since we met, but it was weird because I was interested in both of you, so I said nothing. Then I find out that’s what you want because of your psychic sister connection, but I learned that right after finding out that you're actually immortal magic wielding gods (which is fucking awesome, and, I’m sorry I’m saying fuck a lot). Anyway, it was a lot to process. So, for the past couple of years, it’s mostly just been me afraid to say anything because it had been so long and I didn’t want to mess anything up. Also, I’d die, like, immediately relative to your lifetimes, so I’m not sure what to do with that, but mostly I’ve been afraid of saying anything because, well it’s terrifying, but I also didn’t want to mess anything up (I think I already said that). But\! I know you\! Even if you don’t feel this way, you’re 500 fucking years old\! You can handle basically anything. So it shouldn’t matter.Hence, my earlier declaration of being a fucking idiot. So, regardless of my own internal crisis, I’m sure we could figure out a way to stay friends. But… see now I’m the one hiding something. I don’t like it. And… well… What if it’s not just me? So… I have to tell you. So… shit, did I say I love you yet? That’s what I’m trying to say. I love you. Both of you. Completely.” You and Dee are surprised but not completely shocked and very much enjoy El’s fumbling, ranting, confession, and eventually you and Dee are just smiling at him while he continues and laughing a bit. Dee’s response is “Geeze dude, you are an idiot. We’ve loved you for years. Why do you think Liv made dinner for you by hand?” You tell him much more nicely. And you also didn’t say anything because, well, it’s been a disaster every other time you’d tried it. Then you and Dee sort of attack him and you have an amazing night, week, month… it lasts a while. El then learns that you have a much more aggressive side to you and is completely mesmerized by it. It’s a complete part of your personality that he had never seen before.

Later, he shares that he’s been healing faster than normal. You and Dee had been sensing him for months, but didn’t really know if El was experiencing anything. He has a theory that your magic extends to anyone you get close to. Close enough that you begin to incorporate that person into your own identity. Like, you don’t see yourself as complete without them. But he wasn’t sure if it was a family/friendly sort of connection that you and Dee had with him, or a romantic one. Regardless, it’s what pushed him over the edge to confess to you both.

Now, you and Dee are both married to El (not legally of course, but the three of you don’t particularly care about that). You’ve been married for about 6 months. He now lives with you and Dee at your house, and the three of you are extraordinarily happy together. He proposed the day he told you and Dee about his discovery of his healing. He’d waited forever to tell you how he felt, so he was more or less ready to propose once he knew you felt the same. He had three rings made. One set in black (for him) and two set in a beautiful dark bronze (for you). The bands look like the metal is braided with three strands. The center is tied into a Celtic knot with three stones set into each of the petals: one green (for your eyes), one blue (for Dee’s eyes), and one moonstone (El’s birthstone), he has brown eyes and didn’t like any brown stones, which is why your bands are a dark bronze. His ring is more or less the same, but a little more subtle. When he gives you the rings, he tells you how he likes to think of your trio as not odd, but it follows one of the most numerous patterns in all of the matter than we can see in the universe. Quarks. They’re in all of the matter that we can see. They always are in threes, but there are only two varieties of quarks in a given proton or neutron. So, in every proton and neutron, two of the three quarks are always identical twins. So, the inside bands of the rings have each of their names Uliva, Dianora, and Ellis, with the wearer’s name centered at the bottom. And between each name are the words Up, Down, Up. So it’s a great ring for nerds, and Dee is cool with it too.
